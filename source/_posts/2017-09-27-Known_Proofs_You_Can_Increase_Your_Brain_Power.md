#### Known

##### #1. Reading trains the brain.  

Oxford scientists proved that the process of reading trains the cognitive abilities of the brain. It also activates areas that aren't used at other times. While reading, blood enters the brain areas responsible for concentrate and cognition. It's noteworthy that this effect doesn't occur when watching TV or playing computer games.  

##### #2. Painting improves the work of the brain.  

Painting and contemplations of works of art improve the interaction between brain areas while slowing its aging.

##### #3. Romantic love and maternal feelings are very similar.  

According to brain activity, romantic relationships and maternal feelings are very similar, but there are differences as well. For example, passionate love activates the brain areas  related to sexual arousal. In addition, the feeling of anxiety and fear decreases, and the feeling of euphoria increases. Maternal love activates the areas responsible for the formation of affection.

##### #4. The abundance of sugar in the diet worsens memory and reduces the ability to learn.  

The abundant of fructose in the diet slows down the brain and reduces its ability to learn, remember information, and concentrate. This is because the excess sugar destroys neural connections in the brain. Scientists emphasize that industrially produced sugar is much more harmful(Add to soft drinks, seasonings, sauces, and baby food). However, products containing Omega-3 fatty acids(such as fatty fish, nuts, and fish oil) remove the consequences of the disorder.

##### #5. Pregnancy changes the brain's structure.  

Pregnancy reduces the amount of gray matter in the brain areas responsible for social cognition and the ability to understand other people. All of it is necessary to strengthen the mother-baby connection, help a woman understand the need of her child, and notice possible external dangers.

##### #6. The brain is sensitive to dehydration.  
Our brain is almost 80% water. Therefore, even a moderate loss of fluid(about 2%) reduces concentration and vigilance and leads to deterioration of short-term memory and other cognitive abilities.  

##### #7. Love and hate have a lot in common.  
Love and hate originate in similar brain areas. However, unlike hatred, love significantly reduces the activity of the areas responsible for judgment and logical thinking.  

##### #8. Prolonged stress destroys the brain.  

A decrease in memory, in the ability to learn, in self-control -- these are the consequences that chronic stress is fraught with.  
Also, it contributes to a person feeling irritation, anxiety, tension, and often being distracted.

##### #9. Chronic lack of sleep worsens memory.  
  
During a full night's sleep, brain cells remove toxic compounds dangerous for our brain. If a person never gets enough sleep, it has a devastating effect on their brain cells.
