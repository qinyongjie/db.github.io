#### Instructions  
1. Breath in quietly through your nose for 4 seconds.

3. Breath out through your mouth for 8 seconds.  
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for four "cycles".

#### Hint
* Practice at least twice a day.  
* To help fall asleep, practice when you get in bed or if you wake in the night. If you're feeling stressed or feel like you need to settle your nerves, practice to get a "hit" of calm.  
* You may feel a little light headed when you begin. It will pass as you practice. After a month you may want to extend to 8 cycles.
Effects are subtle to begin but increase with repetition. It takes about 2 months of practice to get best results.
