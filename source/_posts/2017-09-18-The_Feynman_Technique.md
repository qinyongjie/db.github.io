* The Feynman Technique  
  1. **Cut** the learning content into small blocks of knowledge.  
  2. **Choose** two ways, learning small blocks of knowledge one by one for full study, or learning key knowledge for quick study.
  3. **Explain** the knowledge points with the original knowledge after learning.
  4. **Compare** your presentation and information.  
  5. **Repeat** step 3 to 4 for knowledge loopholes. 

[Summary]  
The learning process is to constantly use the old knowledge to explain the new knowledge and transform them into old knowledge.
